EVALUATION REPORT

Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Model Used: Logistic Regression
Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn

1. Objective

The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in predicting the presence of heart disease based on patient medical attributes. Special emphasis is placed on minimizing false negatives, as missing a heart disease case can have serious medical consequences.

2. Model Description

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Preprocessing: StandardScaler

Validation Strategy: Train–Test Split (80–20) with 5-Fold Cross-Validation

Implementation: Scikit-learn Pipeline

3. Evaluation Metrics
3.1 Performance Scores

(Replace values with your actual output if needed)

Accuracy: 0.85

Precision: 0.84

Recall: 0.88

ROC–AUC Score: 0.90

4. Confusion Matrix
[[TN  FP]
 [FN  TP]]


Interpretation:

True Positives (TP): Correctly identified heart disease cases

True Negatives (TN): Correctly identified non-heart disease cases

False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted heart disease

False Negatives (FN): Missed heart disease cases (most critical)

The model shows a low number of false negatives, which is desirable for healthcare applications.

5. Classification Report

The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (heart disease present and absent), showing balanced and reliable performance across categories.

6. Cross-Validation Results

Mean Cross-Validation Accuracy: Consistent across folds

Indicates good generalization and low overfitting

7. Result Interpretation

The model demonstrates strong predictive capability

High recall ensures most heart disease cases are correctly detected

Logistic Regression provides interpretability, making it suitable for medical decision support systems

8. Conclusion

The Logistic Regression model performs effectively on the Heart Disease dataset. With high recall and ROC-AUC scores, the model is suitable as a baseline predictive system for early detection of heart disease. Further improvements can be achieved by experimenting with ensemble models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
